# Auto-Infographics
Convert text files into meaningful infographics.

3rd semester (1st B.Tech Project)
- Created a tool to extract and transcribe important keywords into major topics/sub-topics.
- Fetch images from Google ImageDataset v4 or download images from Google.
- The final output had pre-stored templates(.png/.jpeg/.jpg) where the images are superimposed.
- Four posters are generated for the document shared.

Inspiration - Dr.Sumit Kalra was creating an intelligent infographic tool. 
The vision was to create multiple algorithms to create infographics for multiple document types(differentiated based on filetype .csv, .txt)
